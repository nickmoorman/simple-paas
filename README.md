# Simple PaaS

A simple PaaS solution that aims to mirror the functionality provided by [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) in a way that allows organizations to host it on their own servers.

## Project Goals

This project hopes to provide:
- effortless environment creation/destruction for demoing features
- easy deployment via `git push` or a similar command
- customizable sub-domains to keep deployments easily identifiable
- and more!
